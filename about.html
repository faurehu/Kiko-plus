I'm a Ph.D. student and a McCracken Fellow at the New York University Department of Government. I research political economy of media, privacy and artificial intelligence. I have a MSc in Political Science and Political Economy from the London School of Economics and Political Science, and a BSc in Computer Science with Management from King's College London.

I have lived in Lima, Beijing, London and New York. I enjoy thinking about productivity, personal knowledge management and decentralization.

In my free time I play tennis and soccer. I like stand-up, boardgames and hiking.
